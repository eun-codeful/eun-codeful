- 🤗 Hi, I’m Saeun (@eun-codeful). I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Epidemiology program at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health (soon-to-be Epidemiologist!)
- 💜 I am passionate about reducing disease burdens in vulnerable populations through evidence-based actions.
- 💪 Key skills: epidemiological methods and data collection, management, and analysis (REDCap, STATA, and R)
- 🤓 I’m a lifelong learner: I am currently working to enhance my skills in data-related tools (SQL, Git, and Python).
- 💞️ I am looking for a position at an institution/company that aligns with my vision, where I can further develop as a health data scientist.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have lived (more than 3 months) in 6 different countries during the last 10 years: South Korea, Japan, Australia, Malawi, USA, and Uganda.
